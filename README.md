# raw_libft
This is my Libft for the 42 course. This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon

### **Development**
The projects is divided into three parts:
- First, the development of a ``libft.h`` file and a ``Makefile`` where it is mandatory to include the ``$(NAME)``, ``all``, ``clean``, ``fclean`` and ``re`` rules. It must compile properly, without relinking and output a ``libft.a`` file.
- Secondly, we must re-develop some *libc* functions. They must have the same prototypes as the original functions and we must implement the same behaviour as the originals, the exact same way as defined in the ``man``. It is interesting to use previously coded functions, instead of re-coding constantly the same.
- Thirdly, we have to code a series of additional functions, exactly as described by the given subject: the functions in this part are either not in the *libc* or are part of it but in a different form.

### **Testing**
To test the functions it was essential to develop a ``main.c`` to then compile with the ``libft.a`` file. ``main.c`` file will not be uploaded along with the libft since it was not required by the subject. 

### **Guidelines**
